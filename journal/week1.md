# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 - Week 1

## Root Module Structure

Our root module structure is as follows:

```
PROJECT_ROOT
│
├── main.tf                 # everything else.
├── variables.tf            # stores the structure of input variables
├── terraform.tfvars        # the data of variables we want to load into our terraform project
├── providers.tf            # defined required providers and their configuration
├── outputs.tf              # stores our outputs
└── README.md               # required for root modules
```

## Terraform and Input Variables

### Terraform Cloud Variables

In terraform we can set two kind of variables:
- Environment Variables - those you would set in your bash terminal eg. AWS Credentials
- Terraform Variables - those you would normally set in the .tfvars file

We can set Terraform Cloud variables to be sensitive so they are not shown visibliy in the UI.

### Loading Terraform Input Variables

[Terraform Input Variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

### var flag
We can use the `-var` flag to set an input variable or override a variable in the tfvars file eg. `terraform -var user_ud="my-user_id"`

### var-file flag

Wer can use the -var-file flag to call vcariables with a tfvars file `terraform apply -var-file="testing.tfvars"`

### terraform.tvfars

This is the default file to load in terraform variables in blunk

### auto.tfvars

Any files with the following structure/ending `*.auto.tfvars` or `*.auto.tfvars.json` will alos be automatyically loaded as variablesl like the tfvars file.

### order of terraform variables

Terraform loads variables in the following order, with later sources taking precedence over earlier ones:

- Environment variables
- The terraform.tfvars file, if present.
- The terraform.tfvars.json file, if present.
- Any *.auto.tfvars or *.auto.tfvars.json files, processed in lexical order of their filenames.
- Any -var and -var-file options on the command line, in the order they are provided. (This includes variables set by a Terraform Cloud workspace.)

## Dealing with Configuration Drifts

## What happens if we lose our state file?

If you lose your statefile, you most likley have to tear down all your cloud infrastructure manually.

You can use terraform port but it won't for all cloud resources. You need check the terraform providers documentation for which resources support import.

### Fix Missing Resources with Terraform Import

`terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket bucket-name`

[Terraform Import](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import)
[AWS S3 Bucket Import](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#import)

### Fix Manual Configuration

If someone goes and delete or modifies cloud resource manually through ClickOps. 

If we run Terraform plan is with attempt to put our infrstraucture back into the expected state fixing Configuration Drift

## Fix using Terraform Refresh

```sh
terraform apply -refresh-only -auto-approve
```

## Terraform Modules

### Terraform Module Structure

It is recommend to place modules in a `modules` directory when locally developing modules but you can name it whatever you like.

### Passing Input Variables

We can pass input variables to our module.
The module has to declare the terraform variables in its own variables.tf

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
  user_uuid = var.user_uuid
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
}
```

### Modules Sources

Using the source we can import the module from various places eg:
- locally
- Github
- Terraform Registry

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
}
```

## Considerations when using ChatGPT to write Terraform 

LLMs such as ChatGPT may not be trained on the latest documentation or information about Terraform.

It may likely produce older examples that could be deprecated. Often affecting providers.
